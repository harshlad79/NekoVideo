NekoVideo is an open-source local video player for Android built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

> **Fork status:** This repository is a modified fork of [FellipitoPV/NekoVideo](https://github.com/FellipitoPV/NekoVideo). The current fork is being used to develop and test improved DLNA/UPnP compatibility, with an initial focus on reliable playback and transport controls on Samsung DLNA renderers. Changes made in this fork remain licensed under GPL-3.0.

The app focuses on local playback, folder-based organization, private folders, tag-based organization, and DLNA casting without depending on proprietary cast SDKs.

## Highlights

- Folder-based local video library
- Modern player built on Media3 / ExoPlayer
- Picture-in-Picture, mini player, and background playback
- Continue Watching with reliable progress sync across sessions
- Pinned folders for quick access from the home screen
- DLNA / UPnP casting to TVs and renderers on the local network
- Private folders with password protection, hidden folders, and biometric unlock support
- Video tags with separate normal/private scopes and automatic backups
- No ads, no analytics, no cloud dependency

## What The App Does

### Library and File Management

- Browses your storage as real folders instead of forcing a media-library-only view
- Scans and caches folders that contain videos for faster navigation
- Supports common formats such as `mp4`, `mkv`, `webm`, `avi`, `mov`, `wmv`, `m4v`, `3gp`, and `flv`
- Generates thumbnails and caches them in memory and on disk
- Lets you search items inside the current folder
- Supports sorting by name, date, and file size
- Can show video duration and file size in the grid/list
- Allows pinning up to 10 folders for quick access from the home screen
- Allows creating folders, renaming items, moving items, deleting items, and sharing videos
- Supports opening videos from other apps via `VIEW` and `SEND_MULTIPLE` intents

### Playback

- Uses Media3 / ExoPlayer for local playback
- Folder playback with playlist navigation
- Shuffle playback for the current folder tree
- Double-tap seek with configurable skip duration
- Gesture-based seeking in the player, including stacked double-tap skips
- Vertical swipe gestures for volume and brightness control
- Playback speed control (0.25x to 2x)
- Repeat modes: normal, repeat playlist, and repeat one
- Sleep timer that pauses playback after a chosen duration
- Keep screen on during playback
- Audio track and subtitle track selection
- External subtitle file selection and subtitle size adjustment
- Automatic orientation behavior based on the video
- Background playback through `MediaSessionService`, configurable in settings
- Media notification and lock-screen controls
- Persistent mini player while browsing the app
- Continue Watching: resumes where you left off on both the home card and inside folders, preserving the selected audio/subtitle tracks and external subtitles

### Continue Watching

- Shows a resume card on the home screen for the last video in progress
- Saves progress on pause, on player close, and periodically while playing
- Clears the card automatically when a video reaches ~95% completion
- Remembers the selected audio track, subtitle track, and external subtitle file
- Configurable minimum video duration (1-30 minutes) before progress is tracked
- Option to include or exclude private videos from progress tracking
- Option to clear all continue-watching history from settings

### Picture-in-Picture

- Supports Android PiP mode (entered manually during playback)
- Includes previous, play/pause, and next PiP actions

### DLNA Casting

- Discovers DLNA / UPnP renderers on the local network using SSDP
- Streams local files through an embedded HTTP server
- Supports playlist casting, next/previous navigation, and playback state polling
- Works without Google Cast SDK or closed-source casting dependencies

### Tags

- Create, rename, and delete tags
- Assign tags to one or many videos
- Keep separate tag scopes for normal content and private content
- Shuffle videos using tag include/exclude filters
- Preserves tag references when files or folders are renamed or moved
- Automatic tag backups saved on-device, with import/merge and manual export

### Private Folders and Protected Content

- Supports a dedicated secure folder path and hidden app-managed folders
- Can lock folders behind a password
- Supports biometric unlock after password setup
- Keeps protected folders hidden by default when the app starts
- Plays locked content without creating decrypted temporary copies on disk

Important: the current protection model is not full-file encryption for every byte of the video. It uses password-derived data, obfuscated file and folder names, protected manifests, and on-the-fly header deobfuscation during playback.

### Settings

- Playback settings for background playback, auto-hide controls, seek gestures, volume/brightness gestures, continue watching, and sleep timer
- Interface settings for theme (light, dark, or system; dark mode uses pure black / AMOLED styling) and app language
- Display settings for durations and file sizes
- Storage settings for clearing the thumbnail cache and continue-watching history
- Security settings for password changes and biometric unlock
- Tag management screens with backup and restore for normal and private tags

## Supported Languages

The app currently includes support for:

- Portuguese
- English
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Russian
- Hindi
- Chinese (Simplified)
- Chinese (Traditional)
- System default mode

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Kotlin + Coroutines |
| UI | Jetpack Compose + Material 3 |
| Playback | AndroidX Media3 / ExoPlayer |
| Background media | MediaSessionService |
| Navigation | Navigation Compose |
| Thumbnails | Coil, Glide, MediaMetadataRetriever |
| Local database | Room |
| Serialization | Gson |
| Casting | DLNA / UPnP via SSDP + SOAP |
| Local streaming | NanoHTTPD |
| Build | Gradle Kotlin DSL |

## Privacy

NekoVideo does not include analytics, ads, or third-party tracking.

Network activity is limited to local-network casting features when you use DLNA discovery or playback control.

Most media processing is done on-device, including thumbnail generation, tag storage, remux operations, and private-folder handling.

## Requirements

- Android 11 (API 30) or higher
- Access to local storage
- `All files access` may be required for the folder-based browsing model on supported Android versions

## Building

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
